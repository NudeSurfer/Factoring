#Factoring
Code for factoring large integers

This repository includes some c / assembler code I have written to learn more about factoring large integers and AVX512 instruction set.


Factorials_AVX512_final.c - small program to test different sieving methods for factorial primes.
testfactors.py - a small python 3 to verify found factor for factorials.
factors.txt - file that contains several factors for factorial numbers. I have used these for debugging purposes.
